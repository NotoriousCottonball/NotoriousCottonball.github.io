Metaprogramming, simply put, is writing code that operates on code rather than data. That’s an all-encompassing definition that covers the operation of code compilers like bytecode and code generators like the rails gem. With Ruby, we typically mean something more specific when it comes to Metaprogramming: writing code that writes code Dynamically and At Runtime.

Ruby is a great language for Dynamic Metaprogramming given two key characteristics of its higher-order functionality: Introspection and Reflection. Specifically, Type Introspection and Runtime Reflection.

Type Introspection refers to the ability of a programming language to examine the properties of the program’s objects at runtime. Runtime Reflection, meanwhile, goes a step further and allows a program to actually manipulate the properties of an object at runtime.

Ruby’s Introspection and Reflection allow program’s to modify their own structure and behavior at runtime.

Bottom-Line: We can add a ton of functionality with very few lines of code.

Let’s check out some examples:
