My second Flatiron School project involved creating a Sinatra Web Application with a Modular Structure, Database Persistence, and Responsive Web Pages. The project required a strong grasp of the Sinatra DSL, Object-Relational Mapping via ActiveRecord, and the Bootstrap Front-End Framework. The project approached building a Content Management System(CMS) through a Model, View, Controller(MVC) Development Paradigm and  RESTful Routing.
